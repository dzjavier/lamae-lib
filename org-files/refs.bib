	quantitative reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction. We designed
	primer pairs and TaqMan probes specific for the two cDNAs and available

	To examine the reproducibility of this assay system, we calculated
	the intra-assay and interassay coefficients of variation of the gene
	expression rate and found that a greater than 1.6-fold increase in
	relative gene expression is detectable as a significant change. ETA
	and ETB receptor gene expression was found in all 16 organs of mouse

	patterns essentially agreed with those determined by RNase protection

  abstract = {A full-rank under-determined linear system of equations Ax&#xa0;=&#xa0;b
	has in general infinitely many possible solutions. In recent years
	there is a growing interest in the sparsest solution of this equation—the
	one with the fewest non-zero entries, measured by ∥x∥0. Such solutions
	find applications in signal and image processing, where the topic
	is typically referred to as “sparse representation”. Considering
	the columns of A as atoms of a dictionary, it is assumed that a given
	signal b is a linear composition of few such atoms. Recent work established
	that if the desired solution x is sparse enough, uniqueness of such
	a result is guaranteed. Also, pursuit algorithms, approximation solvers
	for the above problem, are guaranteed to succeed in finding this
	solution.
	
	Armed with these recent results, the problem can be reversed, and
	formed as an implied matrix factorization problem: Given a set of
	vectors {bi}, known to emerge from such sparse constructions, Axi&#xa0;=&#xa0;bi,
	with sufficiently sparse representations xi, we seek the matrix A.
	In this paper we present both theoretical and algorithmic studies
	of this problem. We establish the uniqueness of the dictionary A,
	depending on the quantity and nature of the set {bi}, and the sparsity
	of {xi}. We also describe a recently developed algorithm, the K-SVD,
	that practically find the matrix A, in a manner similar to the K-Means
	algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate this algorithm on several stylized
	applications in image processing.},

  abstract = {Organ blood flow is controlled, in part, by changes in diameter of
	resistance vessels. In thick tissue, vessels can be imaged with a
	microscope using contrast-enhancing methods (e.g., fluorescence)
	and image analysis techniques can be used for quantitative diameter
	estimations. However, a change in the position of a vessel with respect
	to the plane of focus can be misinterpreted as a diameter change.
	In order to address this problem, a 3D image in a light microscope
	is obtained by serial optical sectioning, and a 3D deconvolution
	procedure (Avinash et al., 1991, "Fourteenth Association for Research
	in Otolaryngology Midwinter Meeting, St. Petersberg, FL," Abstract
	156) is used to deblur 3D image data. Deblurred sections are computationally
	projected onto a 2D plane to give an extended-focus image, from which
	diameter estimates of microvessels are made using a quantitative,
	2D diameter-tracking algorithm (Miles, 1987, "Semiautomatic Quantitative
	Image Analysis of Dynamic in Vivo Cochlear Microvessel Diameters."
	Ph.D. dissertation, Univ. Michigan; Miles and Nuttall, 1992, IEEE
	Trans. Biomed. Eng.). Justification for 3D preprocessing before diameter
	analysis is provided by absolute and relative error analyses using
	computer-generated synthetic vessels. The 3D diameter analysis technique
	is validated using a capillary tube of known diameter, filled with
	fluorescent solution. Demonstration of its applicability is shown
	in diameter measurements from the vessels of guinea pig cochlea.
	Our approach, using extended-focus images, minimizes overestimation
	of microvascular diameters and underestimation of relative diameter
	changes. Therefore, unambiguous diameter measurements are possible
	with extended-focus images.},

	signal information and complexity in the time-frequency plane. When
	applied to a time-frequency representation (TFR) from Cohen's class
	or the affine class, the Renyi entropies conform closely to the notion
	of complexity that we use when visually inspecting time-frequency
	images. These measures possess several additional interesting and
	useful properties, such as accounting and cross-component and transformation
	invariances, that make them natural for time-frequency analysis.
	This paper comprises a detailed study of the properties and several
	potential applications of the Renyi entropies, with emphasis on the
	mathematical foundations for quadratic TFRs. In particular, for the
	Wigner distribution, we establish that there exist signals for which
	the measures are not well defined},

  abstract = {Photobleaching and related photochemical processes are recognized
	experimental barriers to quantification of fluorescence by microscopy.
	We have measured the kinetics of photobleaching of fluorophores in
	living and fixed cells and in microemulsions, and have demonstrated
	the spatial variability of these processes within individual cells.
	An inverted fluorescence microscope and a high-sensitivity camera,
	together with high-speed data acquisition by a computer-controlled
	image processor, have been used to control precisely exposure time
	to excitation light and to record images. To improve the signal-to-noise
	ratio, 32 digital images were integrated. After correction for spatial
	variations in camera sensitivity and background fluorescence, the
	images of the relative fluorescence intensities for 0.065 micron2
	areas in the object plane were obtained. To evaluate photobleaching
	objectively, an algorithm was developed to fit a three-parameter
	exponential equation to 20 images recorded from the same microscope
	field as a function of illumination time. The results of this analysis
	demonstrated that the photobleaching process followed first-order
	reaction kinetics with rate constants that were spatially heterogeneous
	and varied, within the same cell, between 2- and 65-fold, depending
	on the fluorophore. The photobleaching rate constants increased proportionally
	with increasing excitation intensity and, for benzo(a)pyrene, were
	independent of probe concentration over three orders of magnitude
	(1.25 microM to 1.25 mM). The propensity to photobleach was different
	with each fluorophore. Under the cellular conditions used in these
	studies, the average rates of photobleaching decreased in this order:
	N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole)-23,24-dinor-5-cholen-22-amine-3
	beta-ol greater than acridine orange greater than rhodamine-123 greater
	than benzo(a)pyrene greater than fluorescein greater than tetramethylrhodamine
	greater than 1,1'dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine.
	The photobleaching appears to be an oxidation reaction, in that the
	addition of saturated solutions of Na2S2O5 to mineral oil microemulsions
	eliminated photobleaching of N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole)-23,24-dinor-5-cholen-22-amine-3
	beta-ol or benzo(a)pyrene. We identified experimental conditions
	to observe, without detectable photobleaching, fluorophores in living
	cells, which can not be studied anaerobically. Useful images were
	obtained when excitation light was reduced to eliminate photobleaching,
	as determined from zero-time images calculated from the exponential
	fit routine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	camera and proved that the iterative method proposed by Llacer and
	Nuñez in 1990 can be derived from the expectation-maximization method
	of Dempster et al for the solution of ML problems. The utility of
	the approach was shown on the reconstruction of images of the Hubble
	space Telescope. This problem deserves further investigation because
	it can be important in the deconvolution of images of faint objects
	provided by next-generation ground-based telescopes that will be
	characterized by large collecting areas and advanced adaptive optics.
	In this paper, we first prove the existence of solutions of the ML
	problem by investigating the properties of the negative log of the
	likelihood function. Next, we show that the iterative method proposed
	by the above-mentioned authors is a scaled gradient method for the
	constrained minimization of this function in the closed and convex
	cone of the non-negative vectors and that, if it is convergent, the
	limit is a solution of the constrained ML problem. Moreover, by looking
	for the asymptotic behavior in the regime of high numbers of photons,
	we find an approximation that, as proved by numerical experiments,
	works well for any number of photons, thus providing an efficient
	implementation of the algorithm. In the case of image deconvolution,
	we also extend the method to take into account boundary effects and
	multiple images of the same object. The approximation proposed in
	this paper is tested on a few numerical examples.},

	were constructed using signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) computed from
	a single image as a quality measure to establish which image components
	may be discarded. The compression efficiency was measured as a function
	of image brightness and SNR. The alterations introduced by compression
	in biological images were estimated using brightness histograms (earth's
	mover distance (EMD) algorithm) and textures (Haralick parameters).
	Furthermore, a microscope test pattern was used to assess the effect
	of compression on the effective resolution of microscope images.},

	a measured cytoplasmic pH of 7.09 (0.01 SEM), whereas nonquiescent
	cells have a pH of 7.35 (0.01 SEM) in the presence of bicarbonate
	buffer. A unimodal distribution of mean cytoplasmic pH in both quiescent
	and nonquiescent cells was identified from populations of cells measured
	on a cell by cell basis. Therefore, unlike earlier studies based
	on cell population averages, it can be stated that cells in each
	population exhibit a narrow range of cytoplasmic pH. However, the
	mean cytoplasmic pH can change based on the physiological state of
	the cells. In addition, there appears to be little, if any, spatial
	variation in cytoplasmic pH in either quiescent or nonquiescent Swiss
	3T3 cells. The pH within the nucleus was always the same as the surrounding
	cytoplasm. These values will serve as a reference point for investigating
	the role of temporal and spatial variations in cytoplasmic pH in
	a variety of cellular processes including growth control and cell
	movement.},

	a 3D model by a set of connected contours that are planar and orthogonal.
	Planar contours overlayed on image data are easily manipulated and
	linked contours reduce the amount of user interaction.1 This method
	solves the contour-to-contour correspondence problem and can capture
	extrema of objects in a more flexible way than manual segmentation
	of a stack of 2D images. The resulting 3D model is guaranteed to
	be free of geometric and topological errors. We show that manual
	segmentation using connected orthogonal contours has great advantages

	effective feedback and control for creating an initial model for,

	but the specimen thickness that can be imaged is limited by depth-dependent
	signal attenuation. Both software and hardware methods have been
	used to correct the attenuation in reconstructed images, but previous
	methods do not increase the image signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) using
	conventional specimen preparation and imaging. We present a practical
	two-view method that increases the overall imaging depth, corrects
	signal attenuation and improves the SNR. This is achieved by a combination
	of slightly modified but conventional specimen preparation, image
	registration, montage synthesis and signal reconstruction methods.
	The specimen is mounted in a symmetrical manner between a pair of
	cover slips, rather than between a slide and a cover slip. It is
	imaged sequentially from both sides to generate two 3D image stacks
	from perspectives separated by approximately 180 degrees with respect
	to the optical axis. An automated image registration algorithm performs
	a precise 3D alignment, and a model-based minimum mean squared algorithm
	synthesizes a montage, combining the content of both the 3D views.
	Experiments with images of individual neurones contrasted with a
	space-filling fluorescent dye in thick brain tissue slices produced
	precise 3D montages that are corrected for depth-dependent signal
	attenuation. The SNR of the reconstructed image is maximized by the
	method, and it is significantly higher than in the single views after
	applying our attenuation model. We also compare our method with simpler
	two-view reconstruction methods and quantify the SNR improvement.
	The reconstructed images are a more faithful qualitative visualization
	of the specimen's structure and are quantitatively more accurate,
	providing a more rigorous basis for automated image analysis.},

	as follows. Suppose that f is a superposition of |T| spikes f(t)=

	Our result may be interpreted as a novel kind of nonlinear sampling
	theorem. In effect, it says that any signal made out of |T| spikes
	may be recovered by convex programming from almost every set of frequencies

	sense that any method succeeding with probability 1-O(N-M) would
	in general require a number of frequency samples at least proportional
	to |T| middot;logN. The methodology extends to a variety of other

	reconstruct a piecewise constant (one- or two-dimensional) object

	(discontinuities) obeys the condition above - by minimizing other

	possess large-scale chromatin unfolding activity; these include the
	VP16 acidic activation domain, BRCA1, E2F1, p53, and the glucocorticoid
	and estrogen steroid receptors. In these studies, proteins were fluorescently
	labeled and targeted to a multimerized array of DNA sequences in
	mammalian cultured cells, and changes in the appearance and/or size
	of the array were observed. This type of experiment is impeded by
	the low throughput of traditional microscopy. METHODS: We report
	the application of automated microscopy to provide unattended, rapid,
	quantitative measurements of fluorescently labeled chromosome regions.
	RESULTS: The automated image collection routine produced results
	comparable to results previously obtained by manual methods and was
	significantly faster. Using this approach, we identified two subdomains
	within the E domain of estrogen receptor alpha capable of inducing
	large-scale chromatin decondensation. CONCLUSIONS: This work confirms
	that, like BRCA1, the activation function 2 region of the estrogen
	receptor has more than one distinct chromatin unfolding domain. In
	addition, we demonstrate the feasibility of using automated microscopy
	as a high-throughput screen for identifying modulators of large-scale
	chromatin folding. The Supplementary Material referred to in this

  abstract = {The natriuretic peptides (NPs) ANF, BNP, and CNP have potent anti-proliferative
	and anti-migratory effects on vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs).
	These properties make NPs relevant to the study of human coronary
	atherosclerosis because vascular cell proliferation and migration
	are central to the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. However, the
	existence and cytological distribution of NPs and their receptors
	in human coronary arteries remain undetermined. This has hampered
	the development of hypotheses regarding the possible role of NPs
	in human coronary disease. We determined the pattern of expression
	of NPs and their receptors (NPRs) in human coronary arteries with
	atherosclerotic lesions classified by standard histopathological
	criteria as fatty streak/early atherosclerotic lesions, intermediate
	plaques, or advanced lesions. The investigation was carried out using
	a combination of immunocytochemistry (ICC), in situ hybridization
	(ISH), and semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Both
	by ICC and ISH, ANF was found in the intimal and medial layers of
	all lesions. BNP was highly expressed in advanced lesions where it
	was particularly evident by a strong ISH signal but weak ICC staining.
	CNP was demonstrable in all types of lesions, giving a strong signal
	by ISH and ICC. This peptide was particularly demonstrable in the
	endothelium, as well as in the SMCs of the intima, media, and vasa
	vasorum of the adventitia and in macrophages. By ISH, NPR-A was not
	detectable in any of the lesions but both NPR-B and NPR-C were found
	in the intimal and the inner medial layers. By RT-PCR, mRNA levels
	of all NPs tended to be increased in macroscopically diseased arteries,
	but only the values for BNP were significantly so. No significant
	changes in NPR mRNA levels were detected by PCR. In general, the
	signal intensity given by the NPs and their receptors by ICC or ISH
	appeared dependent on the type of lesion, being strongest in intermediate
	plaques and decreasing with increasing severity of the lesion. This
	study constitutes the first demonstration of NPs and NPR mRNAs in
	human coronary arteries and supports the existence of an autocrine/paracrine
	NP system that is actively modulated during the progression of atherosclerotic
	coronary disease. This suggests that the coronary NP system is involved
	in the pathobiology of intimal plaque formation in humans and may
	be involved in vascular remodeling.},

	used to prove sampling and ergodic theorems concerning a particular
	class of finite-power signals, which are known as weakly almost periodic.
	The analysis brings to light some noteworthy differences between
	finite-energy and finite-power signal sampling. It is shown that
	the bandwidth of the Fourier transform of a weakly almost periodic
	signal is generally larger than the bandwidth of the power spectrum
	of the signal. Consequently, the signal power spectrum by itself
	does not generally provide enough information to determine the value
	of the time-domain Nyquist rate, that is, the minimum sampling rate
	necessary for exact signal reconstruction in the time-domain. On
	the other hand, it is also shown that the minimum sampling rate needed
	to obtain alias-free spectral estimates is determined by the bandwidth
	of the power spectrum and, consequently, may be lower than the time-domain
	Nyquist rate. Finally, the sampling and ergodic theorems established
	in this paper are used in an analysis of averaged periodogram estimates
	of the power spectrum of a weakly almost periodic signal. It is shown
	that the value of the time shift between consecutive windows may
	contribute to the asymptotic bias of the estimates.},

  abstract = {Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) is generally used to obtain
	information about the number of fluorescent particles in a small
	volume and the diffusion coefficient from the autocorrelation function
	of the fluorescence signal. Here we demonstrate that photon counting
	histogram (PCH) analysis constitutes a novel tool for extracting
	quantities from fluorescence fluctuation data, i.e., the measured
	photon counts per molecule and the average number of molecules within
	the observation volume. The photon counting histogram of fluorescence
	fluctuation experiments, in which few molecules are present in the
	excitation volume, exhibits a super-Poissonian behavior. The additional
	broadening of the PCH compared to a Poisson distribution is due to
	fluorescence intensity fluctuations. For diffusing particles these
	intensity fluctuations are caused by an inhomogeneous excitation
	profile and the fluctuations in the number of particles in the observation
	volume. The quantitative relationship between the detected photon
	counts and the fluorescence intensity reaching the detector is given
	by Mandel's formula. Based on this equation and considering the fluorescence
	intensity distribution in the two-photon excitation volume, a theoretical
	expression for the PCH as a function of the number of molecules in
	the excitation volume is derived. For a single molecular species
	two parameters are sufficient to characterize the histogram completely,
	namely the average number of molecules within the observation volume
	and the detected photon counts per molecule per sampling time epsilon.
	The PCH for multiple molecular species, on the other hand, is generated
	by successively convoluting the photon counting distribution of each
	species with the others. The influence of the excitation profile
	upon the photon counting statistics for two relevant point spread
	functions (PSFs), the three-dimensional Gaussian PSF conventionally
	employed in confocal detection and the square of the Gaussian-Lorentzian
	PSF for two photon excitation, is explicitly treated. Measured photon
	counting distributions obtained with a two-photon excitation source
	agree, within experimental error with the theoretical PCHs calculated
	for the square of a Gaussian-Lorentzian beam profile. We demonstrate
	and discuss the influence of the average number of particles within
	the observation volume and the detected photon counts per molecule
	per sampling interval upon the super-Poissonian character of the
	photon counting distribution.},

	is usually the first step toward an understanding of the mechanisms
	that govern various cell functions. Thus, statistical image analyses
	that can be performed on fluorescence microscopy images of fixed
	or live cells have been routinely applied for biophysical and cell
	biological studies. These approaches measure the fraction of interacting
	particles by analyzing dual color fluorescence images for colocalized
	pixels. Colocalization algorithms have proven to be effective, although
	the dynamic range and accuracy of these measurements has never been
	well established. Spatial image cross-correlation spectroscopy (ICCS),
	which cross-correlates spatial intensity fluctuations recorded in
	images from two detection channels simultaneously, has also recently
	been shown to be an effective measure of colocalization as well.
	Through simulations, imaging of fluorescent antibodies adsorbed on
	glass and cell measurements, we show that ICCS performs much better
	than standard colocalization algorithms at moderate to high densities
	of particles, which are often encountered in cellular systems. Furthermore,
	it was found that the density ratio between the two labeled species
	of interest plays a major role in the accuracy of the colocalization
	analysis. By applying a direct and systematic comparison between

	This is done by estimating simultaneously the maximum threshold of
	intensity for each color below which pixels do not show any statistical
	correlation. The sensitivity of the method was illustrated on simulated
	data by statistically confirming the existence of true colocalization
	in images with as little as 3\% colocalization. This method was then
	tested on a large three-dimensional set of fixed cells cotransfected
	with CFP/YFP pairs of proteins that either co-compartmentalized,
	interacted, or were just randomly localized in the nucleolus. In
	this test, the algorithm successfully distinguished random color
	overlap from colocalization due to either co-compartmentalization
	or interaction, and results were verified by fluorescence resonance
	energy transfer. The accuracy and consistency of our algorithm was
	further illustrated by measuring, for the first time in live cells,
	the dissociation rate (k(d)) of the HIV-1 Rev/CRM1 export complex
	induced by the cytotoxin leptomycin B. Rev/CRM1 colocalization in
	nucleoli dropped exponentially after addition of leptomycin B at
	a rate of 1.25 x 10(-3) s(-1). More generally, this algorithm can
	be used to answer a variety of biological questions involving protein-protein
	interactions or co-compartmentalization and can be generalized to

  abstract = {The EMD algorithm is a technique that aims to decompose into their
	building blocks functions that are the superposition of a (reasonably)
	small number of components, well separated in the time–frequency
	plane, each of which can be viewed as approximately harmonic locally,
	with slowly varying amplitudes and frequencies. The EMD has already
	shown its usefulness in a wide range of applications including meteorology,
	structural stability analysis, medical studies. On the other hand,
	the EMD algorithm contains heuristic and ad hoc elements that make
	it hard to analyze mathematically.
	
	In this paper we describe a method that captures the flavor and philosophy
	of the EMD approach, albeit using a different approach in constructing
	the components. The proposed method is a combination of wavelet analysis
	and reallocation method. We introduce a precise mathematical definition
	for a class of functions that can be viewed as a superposition of
	a reasonably small number of approximately harmonic components, and
	we prove that our method does indeed succeed in decomposing arbitrary
	functions in this class. We provide several examples, for simulated
	as well as real data.},

  abstract = {This review is concerned with two-photon excited fluorescence microscopy
	(2PE) and related techniques, which are probably the most important
	advance in optical microscopy of biological specimens since the introduction
	of confocal imaging. The advent of 2PE on the scene allowed the design
	and performance of many unimaginable biological studies from the
	single cell to the tissue level, and even to whole animals, at a
	resolution ranging from the classical hundreds of nanometres to the
	single molecule size. Moreover, 2PE enabled long-term imaging of
	in vivo biological specimens, image generation from deeper tissue
	depth, and higher signal-to-noise images compared to wide-field and
	confocal schemes. However, due to the fact that up to this time 2PE
	can only be considered to be in its infancy, the advantages over
	other techniques are still being evaluated. Here, after a brief historical
	introduction, we focus on the basic principles of 2PE including fluorescence
	correlation spectroscopy. The major advantages and drawbacks of 2PE-based
	experimental approaches are discussed and compared to the conventional
	single-photon excitation cases. In particular we deal with the fluorescence
	brightness of most used dyes and proteins under 2PE conditions, on
	the optical consequences of 2PE, and the saturation effects in 2PE
	that mostly limit the fluorescence output. A complete section is
	devoted to the discussion of 2PE of fluorescent probes. We then offer
	a description of the central experimental issues, namely: choice
	of microscope objectives, two-photon excitable dyes and fluorescent
	proteins, choice of laser sources, and effect of the optics on 2PE
	sensitivity. An inevitably partial, but vast, overview of the applications
	and a large and up-to-date bibliography terminate the review. As
	a conclusive comment, we believe that 2PE and related techniques
	can be considered as a mainstay of the modern biophysical research
	milieu and a bright perspective in optical microscopy.},

	Digital. Dicho sistema poseía un conjunto de limitaciones entre las
	que se destacaban: el seccionamiento óptico manual y la multiplicidad
	de programas requeridos para su manejo. Estas limitaciones requerían
	largas jornadas de trabajo, entorpecían su utilidad, exponiendo a
	errores de operación. El software desarrollado está destinado a usuarios
	no expertos de microscopios de desconvolución digital y permite el
	control integrado del sistema. Las operaciones integradas por el
	software son: control de la captura de imágenes individuales, seccionamiento
	óptico automático, desconvolución y representación tridimensional.
	El Sistema de Microscopía de Desconvolución Digital ha mejorado notablemente
	su rendimiento disminuyendo los tiempos de operación en un 70% con
	respecto al esquema de funcionamiento manual. Esto minimiza en gran
	medida la probabilidad de cometer errores accidentales durante el

	forming a 3D image of the whole structure by scanning it and collecting
	light through a small aperture (pinhole), allowing in vivo and in
	vitro observations. So far, the confocal fluorescence microscope
	(CFM) is considered a true volume imager because of the role of the
	pinhole that rejects information coming from out-of-focus planes.
	Unfortunately, intrinsic imaging properties of the optical scheme
	presently employed yield a corrupted image that can hamper quantitative
	analysis of successive image planes. By a post-image collection restoration,
	it is possible to obtain an estimate, with respect to a given optimization
	criterium, of the true object, utilizing the impulse response of
	system or Point Spread Function (PSF). The PSF can be measured or
	predicted so as to have a mathematical and physical model of the
	image-formation process. Further modelling and recording noise as
	an additive Gaussian process has used the regularized Iterative Constrained
	Tykhonov Miller (ICTM) restoration algorithm for solving the inverse
	problem. This algorithm finds the best estimate iteratively searching
	among the possible positive solutions; in the Fourier domain, such
	an approach is relatively fast and elegant. In order to compare the
	effective improvement in the quantitative image information analysis,
	we measured the volume of reference objects before and after image
	restoration, using the isotropic Fakir method.},

	we plan to measure n general linear functionals of x and then reconstruct.
	If x is known to be compressible by transform coding with a known
	transform, and we reconstruct via the nonlinear procedure defined
	here, the number of measurements n can be dramatically smaller than
	the size m. Thus, certain natural classes of images with m pixels
	need only n=O(m1/4log5/2(m)) nonadaptive nonpixel samples for faithful
	recovery, as opposed to the usual m pixel samples. More specifically,
	suppose x has a sparse representation in some orthonormal basis (e.g.,
	wavelet, Fourier) or tight frame (e.g., curvelet, Gabor)-so the coefficients
	belong to an lscrp ball for 0 lt;ples1. The N most important coefficients
	in that expansion allow reconstruction with lscr2 error O(N1/2-1p/).
	It is possible to design n=O(Nlog(m)) nonadaptive measurements allowing
	reconstruction with accuracy comparable to that attainable with direct
	knowledge of the N most important coefficients. Moreover, a good
	approximation to those N important coefficients is extracted from
	the n measurements by solving a linear program-Basis Pursuit in signal
	processing. The nonadaptive measurements have the character of "random"
	linear combinations of basis/frame elements. Our results use the
	notions of optimal recovery, of n-widths, and information-based complexity.
	We estimate the Gel'fand n-widths of lscrp balls in high-dimensional
	Euclidean space in the case 0 lt;ples1, and give a criterion identifying
	near- optimal subspaces for Gel'fand n-widths. We show that "most"
	subspaces are near-optimal, and show that convex optimization (Basis
	Pursuit) is a near-optimal way to extract information derived from
	these near-optimal subspaces},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Specific signal detection has been a fundamental issue
	in fluorescence microscopy. In the context of tissue samples, this
	problem has been even more pronounced, with respect to spectral overlap
	and autofluorescence. METHODS: Recent improvements in confocal laser
	scanning microscopy combine sophisticated hardware to obtain fluorescence
	emission spectra on a single-pixel basis and a mathematical procedure
	called "linear unmixing" of fluorescence signals. By improving both
	the specificity of fluorescence acquisition and the number of simultaneously
	detectable fluorochromes, this technique of spectral imaging (SI)
	allows complex interrelations in cells and tissues to be addressed.
	RESULTS: In a comparative approach, SI microscopy on a quantitative
	basis was compared to conventional bandpass (BP) filter detection,
	demonstrating substantial superiority of SI with respect to detection
	accuracy and dye combination. An eight-color immunofluorescence protocol
	for tissue sections was successfully established. Moreover, advanced
	use of SI in fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) applications
	using enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) and enhanced yellow
	fluorescence protein (EYFP) in a confocal set up could be demonstrated.
	CONCLUSIONS: This novel technology will help to perform complex multiparameter
	investigations at the cellular level by increasing the detection
	specificity and permitting simultaneous use of more fluorochromes
	than with classical techniques based on emission filters. Moreover,
	SI significantly extends the possibilities for specialized microscopy
	applications, such as the visualization of macromolecular interactions
	or conformational changes, by detecting FRET.},

	during cell division and are also involved in cell shape and polarity.
	Within epithelial tumors, such as breast cancer, and some hematological
	tumors, centrosome abnormalities (CAs) are common, occur early in
	disease etiology, and correlate with chromosomal instability and
	disease stage. In situ quantification of CA by optical microscopy
	is hampered by overlap and clustering of these organelles, which
	appear as focal structures. CA has been frequently associated with
	Tp53 status in premalignant lesions and tumors. Here the authors
	described an approach to accurately quantify centrosome frequencies
	in tissue sections and tumors, independently of background or noise
	levels. Applying simple optical rules in nondeconvolved conventional
	3D images of stained tissue sections, the authors showed that they
	could evaluate more accurately and rapidly centrosome frequencies
	than with traditional investigator-based visual analysis or threshold-based
	techniques. The resulting population-based frequency of centrosomes
	per nucleus could then be used to approximate the proportion of cells
	with CA in that same population. This was done by taking into account
	baseline centrosome amplification and proliferation rates measured
	in the tissue. Using this technique, the authors showed that 20-30\%
	of cells have amplified centrosomes in Tp53 null mammary tumors.},

	the distribution of FMRFamide-like immunopositive neurons in the
	ventral ganglion of the barnacle Balanus amphitrite collected during
	different seasonal periods. Images of immunostained sections were
	acquired by means of a CCD-camera-equipped microscope and a PC and
	the reference points were taken inside the sections. The FMRFamide-like
	immunopositive neurons detected in the barnacle ventral ganglion
	were grouped into four different classes according to size, shape
	and staining intensity. More numerous FMRFamide-like immunopositive
	neurons were detected in the autumn-collected barnacle than in the
	summer counterpart. The two 3D reconstructions obtained from transverse
	and longitudinal ventral ganglion sections were efficaciously compared
	after 90 degrees rotation of one of them. Comparison of these two
	3D-Rec suggests the presence of at least two groups of FMRFamide-like

	This PSF model is a key component for accurate 3-D image restoration
	of thick biological samples, such as lung tissue. Microscope- and
	specimen-derived parameters are combined with a rigorous vectorial
	formulation to obtain a new PSF model that accounts for additional
	aberrations due to specimen RI variability. Experimental evaluation
	and verification of the PSF model was accomplished using images from
	175-nm fluorescent beads in a controlled test sample. Fundamental
	experimental validation of the advantage of using improved PSFs in
	depth-variant restoration was accomplished by restoring experimental
	data from beads (6  μm in diameter) mounted in a sample with RI variation.
	In the investigated study, improvement in restoration accuracy in
	the range of 18 to 35% was observed when PSFs from the proposed model
	were used over restoration using PSFs from an existing model. The
	new PSF model was further validated by showing that its prediction
	compares to an experimental PSF (determined from 175-nm beads located
	below a thick rat lung slice) with a 42% improved accuracy over the
	current PSF model prediction.},

	kinds of information which changes continually with evolving technology
	and experimental goals. A framework that fully encompasses biological

	posed by a fluid data model is similar to one addressed by the semantic
	web, principally support for arbitrary or user-defined semantics
	and ontologies. However, an analysis framework faces additional challenges
	besides the management of semantics: definition of analytic units
	as transforms between semantic constructs, definition of aggregates
	of analytic units to represent work flows, interfaces to algorithm
	implementations, and maintenance of data provenance or history. A
	collaborative scientific environment also demands that these locally
	defined semantics and transforms be fully transportable for subsequent
	review or analysis. OME incorporates these components in a database-backed
	system targeted at end-user biologists. This presentation will briefly
	describe the various components of OME: the semantic layer (Semantic
	Types - STs), the analytical un its used to transform between STs
	(Analysis Modules), the units of work flow (Analysis Chains), the
	work-flow processor (Analysis Engine), and the transportability layer
	(OME XML). An example of a complex work flow will also be presented
	illustrating how this system is used for automated image classification.},

	it is possible to obtain quantitative temporal and spatial information
	about the binding and interaction of proteins, lipids, enzymes, DNA,
	and RNA in vivo. In conjunction with the recent development of a
	variety of mutant green fluorescent proteins (mtGFPs), FRET microscopy
	provides the potential to measure the interaction of intracellular
	molecular species in intact living cells where the donor and acceptor
	fluorophores are actually part of the molecules themselves. However,
	steady-state FRET microscopy measurements can suffer from several
	sources of distortion, which need to be corrected. These include
	direct excitation of the acceptor at the donor excitation wavelengths
	and the dependence of FRET on the concentration of acceptor. We present
	a simple method for the analysis of FRET data obtained with standard
	filter sets in a fluorescence microscope. This method is corrected
	for cross talk (any detection of donor fluorescence with the acceptor
	emission filter and any detection of acceptor fluorescence with the
	donor emission filter), and for the dependence of FRET on the concentrations
	of the donor and acceptor. Measurements of the interaction of the

	of this approach for correction of donor and acceptor concentrations,

	function of a microscope can be computationally estimated from the
	measured point spread function (PSF) using phase retrieval algorithms.
	The compaction of a 3D PSF into a 2D pupil function suppresses artefacts
	and measurement noise without resorting to rotational averaging.
	We show here that such 'phase-retrieved' pupil functions can reproduce
	features in the optical path, both near the sample and in the microscope.
	Unlike the PSF, the pupil function can be easily modified to include
	known aberrations, such as those induced by index-mismatched mounting
	media, simply by multiplying the pupil function by a calculated aberration
	function. PSFs calculated from such a modified pupil function closely
	match the corresponding measured PSFs collected under the aberrated
	imaging conditions. When used for image deconvolution of simulated
	objects, these phase-retrieved, calculated PSFs perform similarly
	to directly measured PSFs.},

	of two-dimensional images recorded at different focal planes. Each
	of these images contains not only in-focus information from the region

	the remainder of the specimen. Once the imaging properties of the

	can be utilized to remove the out-of-focus information and to correct
	for image distortions. Although theoretical calculations for the
	behavior of an aberration-free microscope system are available, the
	properties of real lenses under the conditions used for biological
	observation are often far from an ideal. For this reason, we have
	directly determined the image-forming properties of an epifluorescence

	Through-focus series of a point object (fluorescently-coated microspheres)
	were recorded on a charge-coupled device image detector. From these
	images, the three-dimensional point spread function and its Fourier
	transform, the optical transfer function, were derived. There were
	significant differences between the experimental results and the
	theoretical models which have important implications for image processing.
	The discrepancies can be explained by imperfections of the microscope
	system, nonideal observation conditions, and partial confocal effects
	found to occur with epifluorescence illumination. Understanding the
	optical behavior of the microscope system has indicated how to optimize
	specimen preparation, data collection, and processing protocols to

	few though inconclusive experiments. It was impossible to demonstrate
	a diabetogenic action with either guinea pig hypophysis or with that
	of fish probably because insufficient doses were injected. The diabetogenic
	action was not obtained by the injection of other organ extracts

  abstract = {E(epithelial)-cadherin is a member of a calcium-dependent family of
	cell surface glycoproteins involved in cell-cell adhesion and morphogenesis.
	Catenins are a large family of proteins that connect the cadherins
	to the cytoskeleton. They are important for cadherin function and
	for transducing signals involved in specification of cell fate during
	embryogenesis. The best characterized catenins include alpha-, beta-,
	gamma-, and p120-catenin. Using specific antibodies, we studied the
	expression and distribution of E-cadherin, and alpha- and beta-catenin
	in developmental stages of Bufo arenarum toad. The three proteins
	were found co-localized in stages 19 to 41 of development. Surprisingly,
	E-cadherin was the only of these three proteins found earlier than
	stage 19. To test whether E-cadherin and beta-catenin have a functional
	role in Bufo arenarum embryogenesis, stage 17 whole embryos were
	incubated with anti-E-cadherin and beta-catenin antibodies. Both
	anti-E-cadherin and anti-beta-catenin antibodies induced severe morphological
	alterations. However, while alterations produced by the anti-beta-catenin
	antibody, showed some variability from the most severe (neural tube
	and notochord duplication) to a simple delay in development, the
	alterations with anti-E-cadherin were homogeneous. These observations
	suggest a critical role for E-cadherin and beta-catenin in the early
	embryonic development of the Bufo arenarum toad. Our results are
	consistent with the developmental role of these proteins in other
	species. One of the most surprising findings was the blockage with
	the anti-beta-catenin antibodies on later embryo stages, and we hypothesize
	that the partial axes duplication could be mediated by the notochord
	induction.},

	cranial nerves were not labeled. N-Cadherin was present in several

	The non-neural ectoderm and the endoderm were always negative. Expression

	in the brain apoptosis of Bufo arenarum induced by cypermethrin (CY),
	the expression patterns of CAS and several cell adhesion molecules

	acute bioassay survival at different doses (39, 156, 625 and 2,500
	microg CY/L) and times (24, 48, 72 and 96 h) of CY treatment were

	a proliferative or regenerative effect, but decreases when the doses
	and/or the biocide exposure time increases, suggesting compromise
	of the cellular cycle control and trigger of an apoptotic wave. However,
	these neurotoxic mechanisms should not involve degradation of N-cadherin
	and alpha-catenin, in contrast of beta-catenin and axonal N-CAM180,
	at least in the initial apoptotic phase. Additionally, an adhesion
	compensatory mechanism by N-CAM180 is observed in the neuron cell

  abstract = {Summary Fluorescent signal intensities from confocal laser scanning
	microscopes (CLSM) suffer from several distortions inherent to the
	method. Namely, layers which lie deeper within the specimen are relatively
	dark due to absorption and scattering of both excitation and fluorescent
	light, photobleaching and/or other factors. Because of these effects,
	a quantitative analysis of images is not always possible without
	correction. Under certain assumptions, the decay of intensities can
	be estimated and used for a partial depth intensity correction. In
	this paper we propose an original robust incremental method for compensating
	the attenuation of intensity signals. Most previous correction methods
	are more or less empirical and based on fitting a decreasing parametric
	function to the section mean intensity curve computed by summing
	all pixel values in each section. The fitted curve is then used for
	the calculation of correction factors for each section and a new
	compensated sections series is computed. However, these methods do
	not perfectly correct the images. Hence, the algorithm we propose
	for the automatic correction of intensities relies on robust estimation,
	which automatically ignores pixels where measurements deviate from
	the decay model. It is based on techniques adopted from the computer
	vision literature for image motion estimation. The resulting algorithm
	is used to correct volumes acquired in CLSM. An implementation of
	such a restoration filter is discussed and examples of successful
	restorations are given.},

	the recovery of transport coefficients is usually limited by spatial

	removes both of these biases when used to fit temporal autocorrelation

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The recently developed technique of high-resolution cytometry
	(HRCM) enables automated acquisition and analysis of fluorescent
	in situ hybridization (FISH)-stained cell nuclei using conventional
	wide-field fluorescence microscopy. The method has now been extended
	to confocal imaging and offers the opportunity to combine the advantages
	of confocal and wide-field modes. METHODS: We have automated image
	acquisition and analysis from a standard inverted fluorescence microscope
	equipped with a confocal module with Nipkow disk and a cooled digital
	CCD camera. The system is fully controlled by a high-performance
	computer that performs both acquisition and related on-line image
	analysis. The system can be used either for an automatic two (2D)
	and three-dimensional (3D) analysis of FISH- stained interphase nuclei
	or for a semiautomatic 3D analysis of FISH-stained cells in tissues.
	The user can select which fluorochromes are acquired using wide-field
	mode and which using confocal mode. The wide-field and confocal images
	are overlaid automatically in computer memory. The developed software
	compensates automatically for both chromatic color shifts and spatial
	shifts caused by switching to a different imaging mode. RESULTS:
	Using the combined confocal and wide-field HRCM technique, it is
	possible to take advantage of both imaging modes. Images of some
	dyes (such as small hybridization dots or counterstain images of
	individual interphase nuclei) do not require confocal quality and
	can be acquired quickly in wide-field mode. On the contrary, images
	of other dyes (such as chromosome territories or counterstain images
	of cells in tissues) do require improved quality and are acquired
	in confocal mode. The dual-mode approach is two to three times faster
	compared with the single-mode confocal approach and the spectrum
	of its applications is much broader compared with both single-mode
	confocal and single-mode wide-field systems. CONCLUSIONS: The combination
	of high speed specific to the wide-field mode and high quality specific
	to the confocal mode gives optimal system performance.},

  year = {2011},
  month = {Feb},
  abstract = {Although confocal microscopes have considerably smaller contribution
	of out-of-focus light than widefield microscopes, the confocal images
	can still be enhanced mathematically if the optical and data acquisition
	effects are accounted for. For that, several deconvolution algorithms
	have been proposed. As a practical solution, maximum-likelihood algorithms
	with regularization have been used. However, the choice of regularization
	parameters is often unknown although it has considerable effect on
	the result of deconvolution process. The aims of this work were:
	to find good estimates of deconvolution parameters; and to develop
	an open source software package that would allow testing different
	deconvolution algorithms and that would be easy to use in practice.
	Here, Richardson-Lucy algorithm has been implemented together with
	the total variation regularization in an open source software package
	IOCBio Microscope. The influence of total variation regularization
	on deconvolution process is determined by one parameter. We derived
	a formula to estimate this regularization parameter automatically
	from the images as the algorithm progresses. To assess the effectiveness
	of this algorithm, synthetic images were composed on the basis of
	confocal images of rat cardiomyocytes. From the analysis of deconvolved
	results, we have determined under which conditions our estimation
	of total variation regularization parameter gives good results. The
	estimated total variation regularization parameter can be monitored
	during deconvolution process and used as a stopping criterion. An
	inverse relation between the optimal regularization parameter and
	the peak signal-to-noise ratio of an image is shown. Finally, we
	demonstrate the use of the developed software by deconvolving images
	of rat cardiomyocytes with stained mitochondria and sarcolemma obtained
	by confocal and widefield microscopes.},

	rate similar to the controls in media containing 6.48 to 10.80 mg
	PQ/L. At 18.00 mg PQ/L survival rate was about 85\%; at 30.00 and
	50.00 mg PQ/L an incremented mortality rate was detected. Their internal
	gills appear to have a critical role in adaptation to exposure to
	PQ. The LC-50 values found helped us conclude that increasing time
	of exposure to PQ produces a decrease of tadpole survival rate. With
	light microscopy, the apical ramification gill tufts exhibited a
	dose response increase of the total volume. At the ultrastructural
	level, an increase in the intercellular spaces and alteration in
	gill epithelium organization were the most notable changes. Furthermore,
	the capillaries showed enlarged endothelial cells, irregular nuclei,
	and numerous cytoplasmatic projections.},

	of cellular processes. Using digital image analysis, agonist-induced
	translocation of green fluorescent protein (GFP) Rac1 to the cellular
	membrane can be estimated quantitatively for individual cells. METHODS:
	A fully automatic image analysis method for cell segmentation, feature
	extraction, and classification of cells according to their activation,
	i.e., GFP-Rac1 translocation and ruffle formation at stimuli, is
	described. Based on training data produced by visual annotation of
	four image series, a statistical classifier was created. RESULTS:
	The results of the automatic classification were compared with results
	from visual inspection of the same time sequences. The automatic
	classification differed from the visual classification at about the
	same level as visual classifications performed by two different skilled
	professionals differed from each other. Classification of a second
	image set, consisting of seven image series with different concentrations
	of agonist, showed that the classifier could detect an increased
	proportion of activated cells at increased agonist concentration.
	CONCLUSIONS: Intracellular activities, such as ruffle formation,
	can be quantified by fully automatic image analysis, with an accuracy
	comparable to that achieved by visual inspection. This analysis can
	be done at a speed of hundreds of cells per second and without the
	subjectivity introduced by manual judgments.},

	the imaging conditions and the models on which such deconvolution
	algorithms are based may lead to artefacts and/or distortions in
	the images restored by application of the algorithms. In this paper,
	artefacts associated with a decrease of fluorescence intensity with
	time or slice in three-dimensional wide-field images are demonstrated
	using simulated images. Loss of intensity, whether due to photobleaching
	or other factors, leads to artefacts in the form of bands or stripes
	in the restored images. An empirical method for correcting the intensity
	losses in wide-field images has been implemented and used to correct
	biological images. This method is based on fitting a decreasing function
	to the slice intensity curve computed by summing all pixel values
	in each slice. The fitted curve is then used for the calculation
	of correction factors for each slice.},

	functions (PSF's) under a variety of imaging conditions. Second,
	using these PSF's, we found that a linear restoration method yielded
	reconstructed images of a well-defined phantom object (a 10-microns-diameter
	fluorescent bead) that closely resembled the theoretically determined,
	best-possible linear reconstruction of the object. Third, this best
	linear reconstruction suffered from a (to our knowledge) previously
	undescribed artifactual axial elongation whose principal cause was
	not increased axial blur but rather the conical shape of the null
	space intrinsic to nonconfocal three-dimensional (3D) microscopy.
	Fourth, when 10-microns phantom beads were embedded at different
	depths in a transparent medium, reconstructed bead images were progressively
	degraded with depth unless they were reconstructed with use of a
	PSF determined at the bead's depth. We conclude that (1) the optical
	model for optical sectioning is reasonably accurate; (2) if PSF shift
	variance cannot be avoided by adjustment of the optics, then reconstruction
	methods must be modified to account for this effect; and (3) alternative
	microscopical or nonlinear algorithmic approaches are required for
	overcoming artifacts imposed by the missing cone of frequencies that

	when tumor cells become invasive and metastatic. Although the integrity
	of cell-cell contacts, such as adherens junctions, is essential for
	the maintenance of functional epithelia, they need to be rapidly
	disassembled during migration. The transmembrane cell adhesion protein
	E-cadherin and the cytoplasmic catenins are molecular elements of
	these structures. Here we demonstrate that epithelial cell migration
	is accompanied by tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin and an
	increase of its free cytoplasmic pool. We show further that the protein-tyrosine
	phosphatase LAR (leukocyte common antigen related) colocalizes with
	the cadherin-catenin complex in epithelial cells and associates with
	beta-catenin and plakoglobin. Interestingly, ectopic expression of
	protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) LAR inhibits epithelial cell migration
	by preventing phosphorylation and the increase in the free pool of
	beta-catenin; moreover, it inhibits tumor formation in nude mice.
	These data support a function for PTP LAR in the regulation of epithelial
	cell-cell contacts at adherens junctions as well as in the control
	of beta-catenin signaling functions. Thus PTP-LAR appears to play
	an important role in the maintenance of epithelial integrity, and
	a loss of its regulatory function may contribute to malignant progression

  abstract = {The emergent role of information theory in image formation is surveyed.
	Unlike the subject of information-theoretic communication theory,
	information-theoretic imaging is far from a mature subject. The possible
	role of information theory in problems of image formation is to provide
	a rigorous framework for defining the imaging problem, for defining
	measures of optimality used to form estimates of images, for addressing
	issues associated with the development of algorithms based on these
	optimality criteria, and for quantifying the quality of the approximations.
	The definition of the imaging problem consists of an appropriate
	model for the data and an appropriate model for the reproduction
	space, which is the space within which image estimates take values.
	Each problem statement has an associated optimality criterion that
	measures the overall quality of an estimate. The optimality criteria
	include maximizing the likelihood function and minimizing mean squared
	error for stochastic problems, and minimizing squared error and discrimination
	for deterministic problems. The development of algorithms is closely
	tied to the definition of the imaging problem and the associated
	optimality criterion. Algorithms with a strong information-theoretic
	motivation are obtained by the method of expectation maximization.
	Related alternating minimization algorithms are discussed. In quantifying
	the quality of approximations, global and local measures are discussed.
	Global measures include the (mean) squared error and discrimination
	between an estimate and the truth, and probability of error for recognition
	or hypothesis testing problems. Local measures include Fisher information},

	for sparse and redundant signal representations. The appeal of such
	a dictionary is obvious-in many cases data naturally comes at different
	scales. A multi-scale dictionary should be able to combine the advantages
	of generic multi-scale representations (such as Wavelets), with the
	power of learned dictionaries, in capturing the intrinsic characteristics
	of a family of signals. Using such a dictionary would allow representing
	the data in a more efficient, i.e., sparse, manner, allowing applications
	to take a more global look at the signal. In this paper, we aim to
	achieve this goal without incurring the costs of an explicit dictionary
	with large atoms. The K-SVD using Wavelets approach presented here
	applies dictionary learning in the analysis domain of a fixed multi-scale
	operator. This way, sub-dictionaries at different data scales, consisting
	of small atoms, are trained. These dictionaries can then be efficiently
	used in sparse coding for various image processing applications,
	potentially outperforming both single-scale trained dictionaries
	and multi-scale analytic ones. In this paper, we demonstrate this
	construction and discuss its potential through several experiments

	us to determine those locations at which two or more types of molecules

	two conditions must be satisfied: 1) the colors emitted by the molecules

	the image and 2) the intensities of each component of the image must
	be within a certain range. Since it is not straightforward to assess
	these two conditions without ambiguity, this can lead to either considering
	false colocalizations as positive, or, conversely, leaving out positive
	locations. In fact, at present, there is not a general procedure
	to determine the area of colocalization that contains those pixels
	that can be considered as really colocalized (i.e., the pixels for
	which the above conditions are fulfilled). As a result, it is the

	biological structure from images obtained by means of optical-sectioning
	microscopy is ill posed. Although the linear least-squares solution
	can be obtained rapidly by inverse filtering, we show here that it
	is unstable because of the inversion of small eigenvalues of the
	microscope's point-spread-function operator. We have regularized
	the problem by application of the linear-precision-gauge formalism
	of Joyce and Root [J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 1, 149 (1984)]. In our method
	the solution is regularized by being constrained to lie in a subspace
	spanned by the eigenvectors corresponding to a selected number of
	large eigenvalues. The trade-off between the variance and the regularization
	error determines the number of eigenvalues inverted in the estimation.
	The resulting linear method is a one-step algorithm that yields,
	in a few seconds, solutions that are optimal in the mean-square sense
	when the correct number of eigenvalues are inverted. Results from
	sensitivity studies show that the proposed method is robust to noise
	and to underestimation of the width of the point-spread function.
	The method proposed here is particularly useful for applications
	in which processing speed is critical, such as studies of living

	A new technique and methodology has been developed and tested for
	delineating subcellular morphology and partitioning overlapping compartments
	at multiple scales. This system is packaged as an integrated software
	platform for quantifying images that are obtained through fluorescence
	microscopy. Proposed methods are model based, leveraging geometric
	shape properties of subcellular compartments and corresponding protein
	localization. From the morphological perspective, convexity constraint
	is imposed to delineate and partition nuclear compartments. From
	the protein localization perspective, radial symmetry is imposed
	to localize punctate protein events at submicron resolution. Convexity
	constraint is imposed against boundary information, which are extracted
	through a combination of zero-crossing and gradient operator. If
	the convexity constraint fails for the boundary then positive curvature
	maxima are localized along the contour and the entire blob is partitioned
	into disjointed convex objects representing individual nuclear compartment,
	by enforcing geometric constraints. Nuclear compartments provide
	the context for protein localization, which may be diffuse or punctate.
	Punctate signal are localized through iterative voting and radial
	symmetries for improved reliability and robustness. The technique
	has been tested against 196 images that were generated to study centrosome
	abnormalities. Corresponding computed representations are compared

  abstract = {Fluorescent protein microscopy imaging is nowadays one of the most
	important tools in biomedical research. However, the resulting images
	present a low signal to noise ratio and a time intensity decay due
	to the photobleaching effect. This phenomenon is a consequence of
	the decreasing on the radiation emission efficiency of the tagging
	protein. This occurs because the fluorophore permanently loses its
	ability to fluoresce, due to photochemical reactions induced by the
	incident light. The Poisson multiplicative noise that corrupts these
	images, in addition with its quality degradation due to photobleaching,
	make long time biological observation processes very difficult. In
	this paper a denoising algorithm for Poisson data, where the photobleaching
	effect is explicitly taken into account, is described. The algorithm
	is designed in a Bayesian framework where the data fidelity term
	models the Poisson noise generation process as well as the exponential
	intensity decay caused by the photobleaching. The prior term is conceived
	with Gibbs priors and log-Euclidean potential functions, suitable

	to be estimated. Monte Carlo tests with synthetic data are presented

  abstract = {A constrained optimization type of numerical algorithm for removing
	noise from images is presented. The total variation of the image
	is minimized subject to constraints involving the statistics of the
	noise. The constraints are imposed using Lanrange multipliers. The
	solution is obtained using the gradient-projection method. This amounts
	to solving a time dependent partial differential equation on a manifold
	determined by the constraints. As t → ∞ the solution converges to
	a steady state which is the denoised image. The numerical algorithm
	is simple and relatively fast. The results appear to be state-of-the-art
	for very noisy images. The method is noninvasive, yielding sharp
	edges in the image. The technique could be interpreted as a first
	step of moving each level set of the image normal to itself with
	velocity equal to the curvature of the level set divided by the magnitude
	of the gradient of the image, and a second step which projects the
	image back onto the constraint set. },

	in a wide-field microscope was investigated experimentally. Dispersion
	in the sample and optics can lead to significant changes in the point
	spread function as wavelength is varied over the range commonly used
	in fluorescence microscopy. For a given sample, optical conditions
	can generally be optimized to produce a point spread function largely
	free of spherical aberration at a given wavelength. Unfortunately,
	deviations in wavelength from this value will result in spherically
	aberrated point spread functions. Therefore, when multiple fluorophores
	are used to localize different components in the same sample, the
	image of the distribution of at least one of the fluorophores will
	be spherically aberrated. This aberration causes a loss of intensity
	and resolution, thereby complicating the localization and analysis
	of multiple components in a multi-wavelength image. We show that
	optimal resolution can be restored to a spherically aberrated image
	by constrained, iterative deconvolution, as long as the spherical
	aberration in the point spread function used for deconvolution matches
	the aberration in the image reasonably well. The success of this
	method is essentially independent of the initial degree of spherical
	aberration in the image. Deconvolution of many biological images
	can be achieved by collecting a small library of spherically aberrated
	and unaberrated point spread functions, and then choosing a point
	spread function appropriate for deconvolving each image. The co-localization
	and relative intensities of multiple components can then be accurately
	studied in a multi-wavelength image.},

	We have used mutually tilted, through-focal section views of the

	stage was constructed for an optical microscope, which with the use
	of a coverslip-free water immersion lens, allowed the collection
	of data sets from intact Drosophila melanogaster embryos at viewing
	directions up to 90 degrees apart. We have devised an image processing
	scheme to determine the relative tilt, translation, and sampling
	parameters of the different data sets. This involves the use of a
	modified phase cross-correlation function, which produces a very
	sharp maximum. Finally the data sets are merged using figure-of-merit
	and local area scaling techniques borrowed from x-ray protein crystallography.
	We demonstrate the application of this technique to data sets from
	a metaphase plate in an embryo of Drosophila melanogaster. As expected,
	the merged reconstruction combined the highest resolution available
	in the individual data sets. As estimated from the Fourier transform,
	the final resolution is 0.25 microns in x and y and 0.4 microns in

	oil immersion—at three different sizes of the confocal detector aperture.
	The measured PSFs are fairly symmetrical, both radially and axially.
	In particular there is considerably less axial asymmetry than has
	been demonstrated in measurements of conventional (non-confocal)
	PSFs. Measurements of the peak width at half-maximum peak height
	for the minimum detector aperture gave approximately 0·23 and 0·8
	μm for the radial and axial resolution respectively (4·6 and 15·9

	in an iterative, constrained deconvolution procedure to process three-dimensional
	confocal data sets from a biological specimen—pea root cells labelled
	in situ with a fluorescent probe to ribosomal genes. The deconvolution
	significantly improved the clarity and contrast of the data. Furthermore,
	the loss in resolution produced by increasing the size of the detector
	aperture could be restored by the deconvolution procedure. Therefore
	for many biological specimens which are only weakly fluorescent it
	may be preferable to open the detector aperture to increase the strength
	of the detected signal, and thus the signal-to-noise ratio, and then
	to restore the resolution by deconvolution.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: It is known that the standard features for lesion
	classification are ABCD features, that is, asymmetry, border irregularity,
	colour variegation and diameter of lesion. However, the observation
	that skin patterning tends to be disrupted by malignant but not by
	benign skin lesions suggests that measurements of skin pattern disruption
	on simply captured white light optical skin images could be a useful
	contribution to a diagnostic feature set. Previous work using both
	skin line direction and intensity for lesion classification was encouraging.
	But these features have not been combined with the ABCD features.
	This paper explores the possibility of combing features from skin
	pattern and ABCD analysis to enhance classification performance.
	METHODS: The skin line direction and intensity were extracted from
	a local tensor matrix of skin pattern. Meanwhile, ABCD analysis was
	conducted to generate six features. They were asymmetry, border irregularity,
	colour (red, green and blue) variegations and diameter of lesion.
	The eight features of each case were combined using a principal component
	analysis (PCA) to produce two dominant features for lesion classification.
	RESULTS: A larger set of images containing malignant melanoma (MM)
	and benign naevi were processed as above and the scatter plot in
	a two-dimensional dominant feature space showed excellent separation
	of benign and malignant lesions. An ROC (receiver operating characteristic)
	plot enclosed an area of 0.94. CONCLUSIONS: The classification results
	showed that the individual features have a limited discrimination
	capability and the combined features were promising to distinguish
	MM from benign lesion.},

  abstract = {Since its introduction in 1983, deconvolution microscopy has become
	a key image-processing tool for visualizing the cellular structures
	of fixed and living specimens in three dimensions and at subresolution
	scale. The last 20 years have seen the development of many different
	applications based on deconvolution microscopy, including a wide
	variety of optical setup and deconvolution algorithms. This chapter
	aims to summarize and to describe in detail the major features of
	this technology, from theoretical aspects to practical solutions.
	It will begin by explaining the principle of image formation in three-dimensional
	optical sectioning microscopy. As deconvolution microscopy provides,
	in essence, a means of overcoming the limits of optical microscopy,
	the second part of this chapter is dedicated to the theoretical and
	experimental description of image generation through a microscope.
	Methods will be detailed for the determination of point spread function,
	as a crucial step for the characterization of any optical system
	and a key preliminary step for image deconvolution. The challenges
	faced and the various possibilities for determining this function
	precisely will be discussed. All possible sources of aberrations
	and image degradation processes will be discussed. In the third part
	of this chapter, we will introduce the acquisition setup and requirements
	for compliance between acquisition and deconvolution processes. Typical
	setups for fixed and living cell observation will be detailed, with
	key features for optimizing speed and reducing artifacts. In the
	fourth and last part of this chapter, we will describe, in theoretical
	terms, the various restoration algorithms commonly used in the field
	of optical microscopy and will provide results obtained with some
	of the commercially available packages. We shall conclude by considering
	the prospects for future solutions (currently under development)
	aiming to handle more easily the huge amounts of data generated by
	rapid multi-dimensional living cell microscopy. Designed for use
	by standard cell biologists and hardware and software engineers and
	developers, this chapter has been written to provide a clear explanation
	of the wide-reaching and powerful domain of deconvolution microscopy.},

	bias electrons, and thermoelectrons and the Gaussian component representing
	readout noise. Two methods are examined for compensating for readout
	noise. One method relies on approximating the Gaussian readout noise
	by a Poisson noise and then using a modified Richardson--Lucy algorithm
	to effect the compensation. This method has been used for restoring
	images acquired with CCD's in the original Wide-Field/Planetary Camera
	aboard the Hubble Space Telescope. The second method directly uses
	the expectation-maximization algorithm derived for the Poisson--Gaussian
	mixture data. This requires the determination of the conditional-mean
	estimate of the Poisson component of the mixture, which is accomplished
	by the evaluation of a nonlinear function of the data. The second
	method requires more computation than he first but is more accurate
	mathematically and yields modest improvements in the quality of the
	restorations, particularly for fainter objects. As a specific example,
	we compare the two methods in restorations of images representative
	of those acquired with that camera; they contain excess blurring
	that is due to spherical aberration and a rms readout noise level

	the upper cerebral cortex, the hippocampal CA1 area, and the hilus
	of the dentate gyrus. Nine morphological parameters, including fractal
	dimension, lacunarity, self-similarity range, solidity, convexity
	and form factor were determined. Then the resultant data were processed

	diversity of the cells, and to determine the dynamics and direction
	of the changes. In both hippocampal areas, the transformation to
	hypertrophied and phagocytic cells was observed, but changes in the

	microglial reaction was characterised by an increase in the complexity

	exact diffraction optical transfer function (OTF) and point spread
	function (PSF) are compared to the geometrical OTF and PSF, respectively,
	for both small and large amounts of defocusing. It follows that geometrical
	optics does not describe diffraction optics very well for any reasonable
	amount of defocusing. Calculation of the diffraction OTF is complicated
	and time consuming, even with a large computer. An empirically derived
	analytic approximation to the diffraction OTF which is much easier
	to calculate, is formulated. It is also shown, and examples are presented
	to demonstrate, that the exact OTF and PSF are different in planes
	at equal distances on the two sides of the in-focus plane.},

	Combined with its nonlinearity, higher harmonic generation microscopy
	provides excellent three-dimensional (3D) sectioning capability,
	offering new insights into the studies of embryonic morphological
	changes and complex developmental processes. By choosing a laser
	working in the biological penetration window, here we present a noninvasive
	in vivo light microscopy with sub-micron 3D resolution and millimeter
	penetration, utilizing endogenous higher harmonic generation signals
	in live specimens. Noninvasive imaging was performed in live zebrafish
	(Danio rerio) embryos. The complex developmental processes within
	> 1-mm-thick zebrafish embryos can be observed in vivo without any
	treatment. No optical damage was found even with high illumination
	after long-term observations and the examined embryos all developed
	normally at least to the larval stage. The excellent 3D resolution
	of the demonstrated technology allows us to capture the subtle developmental
	information on the cellular or sub-cellular levels occurring deep
	inside the live embryos and larvae. This technique can not only provide
	in vivo observation of the cytoarchitecture dynamics during embryogenesis
	with submicron resolution and millimeter penetration depth, but would
	also make strong impact in developmental and structural biology studies.},

	analysis results. Degradations caused by cell preparation, optics,
	and electronics considerably affect most 2D and 3D cell image data
	acquired using optical microscopy. That is why image processing algorithms
	applied to these data typically offer imprecise and unreliable results.
	As the ground truth for given image data is not available in most
	experiments, the outputs of different image analysis methods can
	be neither verified nor compared to each other. Some papers solve
	this problem partially with estimates of ground truth by experts
	in the field (biologists or physicians). However, in many cases,
	such a ground truth estimate is very subjective and strongly varies
	between different experts. To overcome these difficulties, we have
	created a toolbox that can generate 3D digital phantoms of specific
	cellular components along with their corresponding images degraded
	by specific optics and electronics. The user can then apply image
	analysis methods to such simulated image data. The analysis results
	(such as segmentation or measurement results) can be compared with
	ground truth derived from input object digital phantoms (or measurements
	on them). In this way, image analysis methods can be compared with
	each other and their quality (based on the difference from ground
	truth) can be computed. We have also evaluated the plausibility of
	the synthetic images, measured by their similarity to real image
	data. We have tested several similarity criteria such as visual comparison,
	intensity histograms, central moments, frequency analysis, entropy,
	and 3D Haralick features. The results indicate a high degree of similarity

  abstract = {In this paper, we describe an algorithmic framework for the automatic
	detection of diffraction-limited fluorescent spots in 3D optical
	images at a separation below the Rayleigh limit, i.e. with super-resolution.
	We demonstrate the potential of super-resolution detection by tracking
	fluorescently tagged chromosomes during mitosis in budding yeast.
	Our biological objective is to identify and analyse the proteins
	responsible for the generation of tensile force during chromosome
	segregation. Dynamic measurements in living cells are made possible
	by green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagging chromosomes and spindle
	pole bodies to generate cells carrying four fluorescent spots, and
	observe the motion of the spots over time using 3D-fluorescence microscopy.
	The central problem in spot detection arises with the partial or
	complete overlap of spots when tagged objects are separated by distances
	below the resolution of the optics. To detect multiple spots under
	these conditions, a set of candidate mixture models is built, and
	the best candidate is selected from the set based on chi2-statistics
	of the residuals in least-square fits of the models to the image
	data. Even with images having a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as low
	as 5-10, we are able to increase the resolution two-fold below the
	Rayleigh limit. In images with a SNR of 5-10, the accuracy with which
	isolated tags can be localized is less than 5 nm. For two tags separated
	by less than the Rayleigh limit, the localization accuracy is found
	to be between 10 and 20 nm, depending on the effective point-to-point
	distance. This indicates the intimate relationship between resolution
	and localization accuracy.},

	only one section. STUDY DESIGN: Several methods for performing quantitative
	histochemistry, immunocytochemistry or hybridocytochemistry, without
	use of specific commercial image analysis systems, rely on pixel-counting
	algorithms, which do not provide information on the amount of chromogen
	present in the section. Other techniques use complex algorithms to
	calculate the cumulative signal strength using two consecutive sections.
	To separate the chromogen signal we used the "Color range" option
	of the Adobe Photoshop program, which provides a specific file for
	a particular chromogen selection that could be applied on similar
	sections. The measurement of the chromogen signal strength of the
	specific staining is achieved with the Scion Image software program.
	CONCLUSION: The method described in this paper can also be applied
	to simultaneous detection of different signals on the same section
	or different parameters (area of particles, number of particles,
	etc.) when the "Analyze particles" tool of the Scion program is used.},

	benefitted from a strong research revival during the past few years,
	thanks in part to the mathematical connections that were made with
	wavelet theory. To introduce the reader to the modern, Hilbert-space
	formulation, we reinterpret Shannon's sampling procedure as an orthogonal
	projection onto the subspace of band-limited functions. We then extend
	the standard sampling paradigm for a presentation of functions in
	the more general class of ldquo;shift-in-variant rdquo; function
	spaces, including splines and wavelets. Practically, this allows
	for simpler-and possibly more realistic-interpolation models, which
	can be used in conjunction with a much wider class of (anti-aliasing)
	prefilters that are not necessarily ideal low-pass. We summarize
	and discuss the results available for the determination of the approximation
	error and of the sampling rate when the input of the system is essentially
	arbitrary; e.g., nonbandlimited. We also review variations of sampling

	The Richardson-Lucy algorithm is a maximum likelihood estimator for
	the intensity of a Poisson process. We have studied various methods

  abstract = {The discovery of long-range dependence (a kind of asymptotic fractal
	scaling) in packet data from LANs and WANs, was followed by further
	work detailing evidence for multifractal behaviour in TCP/IP traffic
	in WANs. In terms of networking however, physical mechanisms for
	such behaviour have never been convincingly demonstrated, leaving
	open the question of whether multifractal traffic models are of black
	box type, or alternatively if there is anything ‘real’ behind them.
	In this paper we review the evidence for multifractal behaviour of
	aggregate TCP traffic, and show that in many ways it is weak. Our
	study includes classic traces and very recent ones. We point out
	misunderstandings in the literature concerning the scales over which
	multifractality has been claimed. We explain other pitfalls which
	have led to the multifractal case being overstated, in particular
	the possibility of ‘pseudo scaling’ being confused with true scaling,

	In this work we use ultrathin layers to measure the z-response of
	confocal, two-photon excitation and 4Pi laser scanning microscopes.
	Moreover, due to their uniformity over a wide region, i.e. cover
	slip surface, it is possible to quantify the z-response of the system
	over a full field of view area. This property, coupled with a bright
	fluorescence signal, enables the use of polyelectrolyte layers for
	representation on sectioned imaging property charts: a very powerful
	method to characterize image formation properties and capabilities
	(z-response, off-axis aberration, spherical aberration, etc.) of
	a three-dimensional scanning system. The sectioned imaging property
	charts method needs a through-focus dataset taken from such ultrathin
	layers. Using a comparatively low illumination no significant bleaching
	occurs during the excitation process, so it is possible to achieve
	long-term monitoring of the z-response of the system. All the above
	mentioned properties make such ultrathin layers a suitable candidate
	for calibration and a powerful tool for real-time evaluation of the
	optical sectioning capabilities of different three-dimensional scanning
	systems especially when coupled to sectioned imaging property charts.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Automated identification of cell cycle phases of individual
	live cells in a large population captured via automated fluorescence
	microscopy technique is important for cancer drug discovery and cell
	cycle studies. Time-lapse fluorescence microscopy images provide
	an important method to study the cell cycle process under different
	conditions of perturbation. Existing methods are limited in dealing
	with such time-lapse data sets while manual analysis is not feasible.
	This paper presents statistical data analysis and statistical pattern
	recognition to perform this task. RESULTS: The data is generated
	from Hela H2B GFP cells imaged during a 2-day period with images
	acquired 15 minutes apart using an automated time-lapse fluorescence
	microscopy. The patterns are described with four kinds of features,
	including twelve general features, Haralick texture features, Zernike
	moment features, and wavelet features. To generate a new set of features
	with more discriminate power, the commonly used feature reduction
	techniques are used, which include Principle Component Analysis (PCA),
	Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Maximum Margin Criterion (MMC),
	Stepwise Discriminate Analysis based Feature Selection (SDAFS), and
	Genetic Algorithm based Feature Selection (GAFS). Then, we propose
	a Context Based Mixture Model (CBMM) for dealing with the time-series
	cell sequence information and compare it to other traditional classifiers:
	Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Network (NN), and K-Nearest
	Neighbor (KNN). Being a standard practice in machine learning, we
	systematically compare the performance of a number of common feature
	reduction techniques and classifiers to select an optimal combination
	of a feature reduction technique and a classifier. A cellular database
	containing 100 manually labelled subsequence is built for evaluating
	the performance of the classifiers. The generalization error is estimated
	using the cross validation technique. The experimental results show
	that CBMM outperforms all other classifies in identifying prophase
	and has the best overall performance. CONCLUSION: The application
	of feature reduction techniques can improve the prediction accuracy
	significantly. CBMM can effectively utilize the contextual information
	and has the best overall performance when combined with any of the
	previously mentioned feature reduction techniques.},

	It has become a quantitative technique for probing cellular structure

	Transform Infrared (FTIR) image maps of tissue sections are presented.
	A villoglandular adenocarcinoma from a cervical biopsy with a number
	of interesting anatomical features was used as a model system to
	demonstrate the efficacy of the technique. METHODS: Four FTIR images
	recorded using a focal plane array detector of adjacent tissue sections
	were stitched together using a MATLAB(R) routine and placed in a
	single data matrix for multivariate analysis using Cytospectrade
	mark. Unsupervised Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (UHCA) was performed
	simultaneously on all 4 sections and 4 clusters plotted. The four
	UHCA maps were then stacked together and interpolated with a box
	function using SCIRun software. RESULTS: The resultant 3D-images
	can be rotated in three-dimensions, sliced and made semi-transparent
	to view the internal structure of the tissue block. A number of anatomical
	and histopathological features including connective tissue, red blood
	cells, inflammatory exudate and glandular cells could be identified
	in the cluster maps and correlated with Hematoxylin & Eosin stained
	sections. The mean extracted spectra from individual clusters provide
	macromolecular information on tissue components. CONCLUSION: 3D-multivariate
	imaging provides a new avenue to study the shape and penetration
	of important anatomical and histopathological features based on the
	underlying macromolecular chemistry and therefore has clear potential
	in biology and medicine.},

	In this study, human erythrocytes were exposed to UV light to investigate
	the effects of UV irradiation (UVI) on autofluorescence. Our results
	showed that high-dose continuous UVI enhanced erythrocyte autofluorescence,
	whereas low-dose pulsed UVI alone did not have this effect. Further,
	we found that H(2)O(2), one type of reactive oxygen species (ROS),
	accelerated autofluorescence enhancement under both continuous and
	pulsed UVI. In contrast, continuous and pulsed visible light did
	not result in erythrocyte autofluorescence enhancement in the presence
	or absence of H(2)O(2). Moreover, NAD(P)H had little effect on UVI-induced
	autofluorescence enhancement. From these studies, we conclude that
	UVI-induced erythrocyte autofluorescence enhancement via both UVI-dependent
	ROS production and photodecomposition. Finally, we present a theoretical
	study of this autofluorescence enhancement using a rate equation

	For solving such a problem, we introduce a novel multiple kernel

  number = {6},
  abstract = {This paper is concerned with quantifying shift-variance of linear
	systems with continuous-time input and discrete-time output. We first
	introduce a notion of -shift-invariance for the system. It specifies
	how the system should respond when the input signal is shifted. For
	generalized sampling processes, the property is characterized by
	the sampling kernel, and is shown to be equivalent to lack of aliasing
	and to shiftability. We then define a shift-variance level which
	describes how far the system can be possibly away from the set of
	systems that are -shift-invariant. The level is defined to be the
	maximum of the induced norms of the commutators of the system and
	the shift-operators (both continuous-time or discrete-time are necessarily
	involved). A shift-variance measure is then defined to be the ratio
	of the shift-variance level to the system norm, further divided by
	two so that the measure is between zero and unity. For generalized
	sampling, we obtain analytical formulas for the shift-variance level
	and the shift-variance measure. The results allow us to analyze the
	shift-variance of, among others, the discrete-time wavelet transform
	(DWT) and the short-time Fourier transform (STFT). We obtain a simple
	relation between the shift-variance levels at all scales of the DWT,
	and show that the shift-variance measures are identical at all scales.
	We calculate the shift-variance level and the shift-variance measure
	of some typical DWTs and the STFTs.},

  abstract = {In this article, we discussed the emerging informatics issues of high-throughput
	screening (HTS) using automated fluorescence microscopy technology,
	otherwise known as high-content screening (HCS) in the pharmaceutical
	industry. Optimal methods of scoring biomarkers and identifying candidate
	hits have been actively studied in academia and industry, with the
	exception of data modeling topics. To find candidate hits, we need
	to score the images associated with different compound interventions.
	In the application example of RNAi genome-wide screening, we aim
	to find the candidate effectors or genes which correspond to the
	images acquired using the three channels. Scoring the effectors is
	equivalent to scoring the images based on the number of phenotypes
	existing in those images. Our ultimate objective of studying HTS
	is to model the relationship between gene networks and cellular phenotypes,
	investigate cellular communication via protein interaction, and study
	the disease mechanism beyond the prediction based on the molecular
	structure of the compound. Finally, computational image analysis
	has become a powerful tool in cellular and molecular biology studies.
	Signal processing and modeling for high-throughput image screening
	is an emerging filed that requires novel algorithms for dynamical
	system analysis, image processing, and statistical modeling. We hope
	that this article will motivate the signal processing communities
	to address challenging data modeling and other informatics issues
	of HTS.},

  abstract = {Cell migration is a field of intense current research, where biologists
	increasingly rely on methods and expertise from physics and engineering.
	Signal processing approaches can contribute significantly to this
	research, most notably to help analyze the exploding quantity of
	imaging data produced with standard and new microscopy techniques.
	In this article, we first provide a brief background on the importance
	of understanding cell movements, then review a selection of current
	efforts on tracking moving cells, with an emphasis on deformable
	model approaches (some ideas expressed in this article have been
	previously discussed. We will point out some of the main difficulties
	posed by cellular imaging, discuss advantages and limitations of
	different tracking techniques, and suggest a few directions for future
